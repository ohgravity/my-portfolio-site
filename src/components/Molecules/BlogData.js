        I’ve recently finished my first round of #100DaysOfCode. The hashtag and
        ethos behind it were created by Alex Kalloway (@ka11away). According to
        the official website, 100daysofcode.com, the movement was set up to
        encourage better coding habits. Although mainly popular with beginner
        programmers, it’s certainly not limited to that group. The hashtag is
        said to help build positive habits, but it really facilitates much more.
        In the 100 non-consecutive days (...I’ll get to that in a bit) I spent
        on the challenge, I gradually found other less apparent benefits along
        the way, like little personal growth Easter eggs.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        What exactly is 100 Days of Code, you ask? These are the two main rules:{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.</li>
          <li>
            Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        This minimalist structure allows each learner an appropriate amount of
        space to explore its impact in a variety of ways. Not only has this
        challenge helped me form good habits, but it has also helped with:
        <ul>
          <li>networking and job searching</li>
          <li>getting over my fear of asking for help</li>
          <li>meeting people of a wide variety of tech and life backgrounds</li>
          <li>learning how other people THINK about programming</li>
        </ul>{" "}
        I’ll talk about each of these points as they relate to the challenge.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, when I started, it was abundantly clear that I was
        tweeting into a vacuum. I had about 5 Twitter followers to start with,
        so my tweet engagement amounted to 3 likes from bots dedicated to
        following the hashtag. “Hello?? Is anyone there?? Hello!!” I wanted to
        yell, with plenty of delay and reverb for good effect. In the
        apocalyptic silence that followed, it dawned on me that this so-called
        productivity enhancing hashtag was actually also a form of online
        networking. Oh.{" "}

        At first, I felt self-conscious liking and commenting on other
        #100DaysOfCode tweets. I didn’t know those people, and I didn’t have a
        clue what most of them were tweeting about. It felt like walking into a
        room full of people speaking a language you don’t know, and trying to
        strike up a conversation in your own language (yes, I speak from
        experience, and I’m actually pretty good at it by now). But I soon
        realized that, much like when crashing a random cocktail party, the only
        way to get people to listen to you is to approach them first, in the
        most authentic and relatable way you can.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I have about 250 Twitter followers. I don’t consider them an
        “audience”. I’m not performing. I consider them a support network,
        emotionally and technically. I’d like to strengthen that in the future
        by engaging more with others’ tweets. There have been a few kind souls
        who really tried to help when I tweeted about tech problems I was
        having. And there are several conspicuous and much appreciated
        individuals who are always sending out cheerful and supportive vibes,
        which REALLY matters a lot when you’re self-teaching and learning in
        isolation during a pandemic. And I love seeing how people from many
        places around the world are learning to code! Just for a few examples: I
        now have some inkling of what the dev job search situation is like in
        India (extremely competitive!), what concerns programmers have in rural
        North America (a lot of job opportunity variation over regions), and the
        pros and cons of working in Silicon Valley (yes, there seem to be some
        cons). Since I can read Japanese, I have also enjoyed hearing about how
        some Japanese students are learning and what tools they use. One day, I
        asked my followers for their thoughts on 100 Days of Code. I was met
        with a fairly constant refrain of appreciation for the community support
        the hashtag opens up. I think that we all come to feel that way, even if
        we didn’t at first.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the more I engaged with others, the more I learned, and the
        more feedback I received. A win-win. One thing I didn’t want to do, at
        the outset, was tweet anything especially personal. I still lean in this
        direction, but I gradually discovered that people who tweet something
        personal from time to time tended to have more authentic and interesting
        interactions than I did. So I guess it pays to be semi-vulnerable to a
        point (if it’s too much, I hit mute. Twitter can't cover anyone’s
        therapy needs). I save my shit-posting for other social media platforms
        where the only people seeing it are friends in real life who understand
        my brand of humor. I’m pretty happy with how that’s working. Networking
        on Twitter is not so scary, it seems.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Another rabbit hole I explored in this challenge was the habit-forming
        mechanism itself. You are supposed to code for at least an hour every
        day and tweet about it. Dear readers, please raise your hand (even
        though I can’t see) if consistency is a perennial challenge for you.
        From ADHD, to depression, to tough home situations, or for other
        reasons, consistency is just rather elusive for some people, including
        me. Yes, I have managed in the past to be consistent enough to be a good
        team member on a medical research study, and as a teacher in public
        schools. But it took an embarrassingly mind-blowing amount of effort to
        do so.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In regard to consistency and the 100DaysOfCode challenge, I saw some
        interesting things happening on my Twitter timeline. Many people, some
        of whom admitted having depression, shared that they “failed” the
        challenge by not tweeting every day, and forlornly asking others, “What
        now?” The flipside of that often touted benefit of this challenge,
        “public accountability”, is that plenty of people get
        publicly...humiliated. Some of them straight up quit tweeting about
        programming at all (and maybe stopped programming?), which is just sad,
        and clearly not the intention of the movement’s founder.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is my take on the situation. It has been an especially rough year,
        as we all know. There were tons of times when I broke my tweeting
        streak. A lot of days I had coded, but didn't think to tweet, since
        Twitter hadn't grown on me (yet? umm). At first I panicked. My inner
        monologue went on and on with negative self-talk: <br />
        <br />
        “See? You can’t do this. Look at Debra [not a real person], she's a
        tweeting machine. Just like clockwork. Ugh. You think you could handle
        being a dev?? <small>
          [and permanently online for all eternity]
        </small>{" "}
        Huh-uh. Abandon ship!” <br />
        <br />
        But after I muzzled that little voice, I was left with my unshakeable
        goal to become a developer, make a decent income while enjoying a
        stimulating career, move into a nice place with lots of plants and a
        record collection, and live happily ever after.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        There is simply no alternative. And that is what drives me forward.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        So I didn’t tell anyone when I broke my streak. Why self-flagellate,
        especially publicly, when it just drags you down more?{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I just kept going, and tried to do better every time. There was no
        drama, and I continued getting support from my awesome followers. And
        what was the result? I have not been perfectly consistent, but my level
        of consistency has very noticeably increased since starting the
        challenge. I’m not satisfied, but the fact that I became stronger and
        better able to work through difficult conditions means I am raising the
        bar for the next round of 100 Days. Smart people are always telling me,
        “Don’t race against the others. Race against yourself.” So that is what
        I’m doing. Yes, it’s important to try to meet others’ expectations since
        no one is an island and we need to be interdependent, but it is equally
        important to know yourself and work in a way that will not lead to
        burn-out or otherwise harm your well-being. I believe this mindset is
        the most conducive to long-term growth and life satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short: People can and should be allowed to progress without being
        perfect.{" "}

        Until this point, I have talked mainly about the psycho-social effects
        of the challenge. However, LET. IT. BE. KNOWN. that I did cover a lot of
        ground technically, including but not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Making my first project from scratch (this site, soon to incorporate
            an API)
          </li>
          <li>Completing 2 full-stack apps </li>
          <li>
            Completing several other small projects with tutorial guidance
          </li>
          <li>Contributing CSS support on a friend’s startup </li>
          <li>
            Exploring my musical interests with a generative music project (blog
            entry coming soon){" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Developing with vanilla JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Styled
            Components, Bootstrap, flexbox, ARIA attributes and screen reader
            testing, GatsbyJS, MongoDB, Postman, and others.
          </li>{" "}
        </ul>
        In the future, I will be writing more in-depth technical blog posts
        about what I am learning. But for now, I just can say that I am proud of
        what I’ve done in these 100+ days, especially in pandemic isolation.
        I’ve become a more patient, determined, and curious programmer through
        improved consistency and insight gained from observing other programmers
        I admire. Not to mention my increased capability to ask for help, and
        the wonderful responses I often received.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Web development as a career offers so much – the possibility of career
        advancement, being able to work from almost anywhere, and intellectual
        stimulation, among other benefits. I understand that developers’ lives
        aren't always rosy and there is tedious work to be done, but every day
        I’m increasing my ability to think more abstractly, problem-solve, and
        expand the virtual world I know – all from learning programming. I can’t
        verify this in a quantifiable way (yet), but I would say that my general
        problem-solving abilities in all areas of my life have improved as a
        result of learning to code. There is just a unique satisfaction in
        taking concrete actions and seeing a problem go away. We can’t always do
        this in every area of our lives, but to the extent that we can, it’s an
        amazing feeling. In the future, I’d love to spend more time on projects
        tying together my love of music and my passion for accessibility, with
        programming. But I’m also just a generally curious person and can get
        interested in a variety of projects, especially if they work to solve
        interesting problems.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, I will start a second round of the 100 Days challenge. What will I
        change in the next round?{" "}
        <ul>
          <li>Set more concrete technical goals, improve time-management</li>
          <li>
            Take a more holistic approach to habit formation: exercise,
            yoga/meditate, sleep hygiene
          </li>
          <li>
            Accountability: Now that I’m stronger in my habit, I’ll hold myself
            more accountable than before
          </li>
          <li>
            Reach out more intentionally to people online I want to get to know
          </li>
          <li>Try to help more beginners who ask for help </li>
          <li>
            Go for more of a teaching approach than a reporting one when I tweet
          </li>
          <li>Spread more positive vibes (we can never get enough!)</li>
        </ul>{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, everything is what we make of it, whether that’s life itself
        or the projects and relationships contained therein. I encourage others
        to do what I did and make the challenge fit your life rather than the
        other way around. Being strict with oneself is important for growth of
        course, and I don’t want to give the impression that I am lax about
        important rules or don’t want to push myself out of my comfort zone in
        order to improve. My point is that self-improvement is not
        one-size-fits-all and shouldn’t be considered as such. I look forward to
        seeing what more I can accomplish as I continue to strengthen my life
        and programming habits. My last words to anyone reading this?
      </p>{" "}
      <p>Make the 100 Days of Code challenge YOURS. Make it work for you.</p>
